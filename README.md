# TI2Net
This is the official implementation of our WACV2023 paper: [TI2Net: Temporal Identity Inconsistency Network for Deepfake Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Liu_TI2Net_Temporal_Identity_Inconsistency_Network_for_Deepfake_Detection_WACV_2023_paper.html)

We referred much to the source code of [arcface](https://github.com/ronghuaiyang/arcface-pytorch/tree/master) and [LRNet](https://github.com/frederickszk/LRNet)

# Data pre-processing
